currently, we are just looking at longest line


from rangeImage extract points (line candidate points)
from those, find best fit line (using best fit line algo.) (gives eequation" y = mx+b) (m is the slope, gradient which we can use to find theta)
find centroid via mean(x), mean(y) (maybe use median)
calculate error threshold of the line to see if it fits sail (maybe use rms error)

output: line info: 

find the longest line that is within the error
